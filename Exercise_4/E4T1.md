# Identify changes

Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Change security group settings to not allow ssh connections from the internet by restricting the IPs that are allowed to communicate to application server.
- Remove ability for ssh login by using the AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service to access the application server.

# Preventing access to sensitive data

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Remove access to the S3 "secret" recipe bucket by limiting privilege access in the IAM Role attached to the instances.
- Enable client side encryption in the S3 bucket allowing access only from a user who keeps and maintains the key.
- Enable server side encryption in the S3 bucket.
