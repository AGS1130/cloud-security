Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security. Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

**Problem:** The IAM Role (instance role policy) is set in such a way that all S3 buckets have full access from the application server which is a violation of the
least privilege principle.

**Solution:** The IAM Role should be specific to the specific bucket (Free Recipe) and should be accessible from the application server for actions to be
performed on them.

# Poor practice 2

**Problem:** Both public and private subnet networks allow all traffic on all ports.

**Solution:** The Web Application should be reachable only from the Application Load Balancer in order to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet and to reduce the ability for malicious actions performed by an attacker.
